# Implementation Plan

## Overview
This implementation plan breaks down the Drink Tracker logic integration into discrete, manageable coding tasks. Each task builds incrementally on previous work, ensuring the app remains functional throughout development.

## Current State Analysis
The app currently has:
- Basic UI screens: Home, Statistics (with graph and achievement), History, Bottom Navigation
- Static data structures: drinks list, history list (hardcoded), achievement list (hardcoded), app settings
- Basic services: drinks service, history service, ml service, popup service, utils service
- Theme files: colors and font sizes
- Wave animation widget for water visualization
- Calendar widget for date selection

## What Needs to Be Built
The app needs:
- Data persistence layer (SharedPreferences)
- User profile management and onboarding flow
- State management (Provider) to replace hardcoded data
- Business logic services for water tracking, achievements, coins, shop, and aquarium
- Aquarium gamification system with fish and decorations
- Shop system for purchasing items with coins
- Settings screen for profile editing
- Integration of all existing UI with new backend logic

2. Set up state management with Provider
3. Create onboarding flow for new users
